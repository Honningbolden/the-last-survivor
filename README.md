# The Last Survivor: An Interactive Storybook Experience
This project is a product of my 2-week course in Storytelling at The Danish School of Media & Journalism (3rd Semester).

### Brief Creative Explanation
In this project I try to combine the experience of a storybooks with audio players, with the immersion of video games.

#### Story
Waking up in a dusty infirmary on a foreign planet, without any recollection of your identity. The rusty needle in your arm is evident that you're not supposed to be alive. An old helmet and a pair of boots are left at your disposal. You put them on, and open the door to the outsideâ€“the atmospheric vacuum immediately puuls out all that was left in the room.
As you walk through the rocky landscape you uncover hidden in artefacts from over-industrialization, and through the fog of amnesia you slowly reveal fragments of your own origin story.

#### How to Play

The story is told in passages: pieces of audio that plays as you progress. Audio passages are represented by spheres and they are triggered by walking into them. When a sphere is **blue** it means that it's ready to be played; when it's **red** it means that this is the audio you want to trigger next but it's predecessor has not finished playing yet.

###### Controls
You'll control yourself in first-person, but you have to options:
1) **Using your hands and webcam**
    * Use your **right index finger** to control where you look.
    * Use the distance between your **left index finger and thumb** to control how fast the player moves forward (you'll always move in the direction you're looking).
        * When you're fingers are touching, you will not move.
        * When you're fingers are spaced far apart you move as full speed.
2) **Keyboard and mouse**
    * W-A-S-D to move the player
    * Cursor controls orientation
