# The Last Survivor: An Interactive Storybook Experience
A 2-week Storytelling course project at The Danish School of Media & Journalism (Coded Design, 3rd Semester).

## Brief Creative Explanation
**The Last Survivor** combines the immersive experiecen of storybooks and audio with the interactivity of video games.
Move through a forgotten world, triggering narrative passages as you explore—where each choice brings you closer to your lost identity.

## Story
You wake up in a dusty infirmary on a foreign planet, with no recollection of your identity. A rusty needledrop in your arm suggest you weren't meant to wake up again. An old helmet and a pair of boots are left with you. Stepping outside, the vacuum of the atmosphere tears away what little remians the room behind you.
As you wander through the rocky landscape, you encounter relics of over-industrialization and, through the fog of amnesia, you slowly reveal fragments of your own origin story.
